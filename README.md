# Brain-Train

Welcome to Brain-Train. This is a simplistic game meant to test some quiz knowledge. It is comprised of: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

There is a Brain-Train logo and begin button, which triggers its own function to start the quiz.

There is a quiz area that loops through the questions when an option is selected and submitted. 
There is also a tally area to score your correct and/or incorrect answers.

At the end it congratulates you and tells you your score.

There is a linked up 404 page to direct you back to the site if any errors occur.


## User stories

First time visitor goals:

 As a first time visitor I want people to easily understand the main purpose of the site and its functions and to easily navigate around the site.

 ## Wireframe

I simply drew my wiregframe and listed my initial divs etc to help me plan. I have since joined balsamiq to use a digital wireframe for the future as advised by those on slack etc.

I used console.log() to debug in dev tools to see which parts of my code were not working and so I was able to get to the correct line of code and fix it as I went. 


## Deployment

It has been deployed to github pages at- 

## Unfixed bugs

Here I was unable to fix how to stop questions 2 and 3 from autoselecting an answer as the submit buttons weren't coming up as disabled as they were on question 1. I had tried resetting the form but could not get it to work.
